# DAY 4: Scripting and going your own way

Today we will be looking at some scripting tools that aren't specific to ROS but will come in handy when looking to deploy your solutions.

## Part 1: ROSbags and scripts

First we will start with the last ROS specific thing in our course which is ROSbags. ROSbags allow you to capture topics while the system is running and stores them so you can view them later. This is useful in many different ways, one of the most popular usages is creating maps offline. As you can imagine SLAM takes a lot of resources to constantly update and build a map. 

## Part 2: Doing your own thing

For now we have covered all the basics of ROS2 and you should have the skills to get started working on your own projects. From here feel free to go back and work on anything you weren't able to finish before or come up with your own driving scenario. Start by using the simulation environment and then if the pioneers are available feel free to trial your scenario.
